title:  "Contact Trace Identity Angle"
---


Approximately a week ago, decided to be a part of a solution about covid-19.
After chasing myself to a practical fit, attached to "Contact Trace" Softwares. 
Did a preliminary current analysis, can be found in  <a href="{% post_url 2020-03-28-Tracing-Contact-Tracing %}" target="_blank"> this </a>  post. 

However, ended up chasing usual "Identity Crisis" as an Identity and Access Management specialist in very same context.  


Eventhough many of the listed products listed in post 
<a href="{% post_url 2020-03-28-Tracing-Contact-Tracing %}" target="_blank"> Tracing "Contact Tracing"  </a>  claims to  
comply with GDPR or equivalent, respecting user's anonymity etc. , still there are a number of open points regarding 
Identity as a concept itself.  

Not only bounded with privacy issues, while ensuring end to end coverage in terms of 
"Verifiable Sovereign Identity", also respect human values, evaluate future, be fast , be efficient , think practical ...

What do we have in hand? 

### Current Identity Implementations in Contact Trace Software's

Not all apps has been published yet. 
- **WHO** app is not featuring contact trace yet and when you install the application you just see a mobile version of their official web page.
- **tracetogether** application requires an OTP authentication send to a number starting with +65 XXXXXXXXX , 
which initially means the main/central "verifiable identity" link is established using telco infrastructure. 
The collected bluetooth identities around that particular device is the "temporary ID" created on device. 
The "temporary ID" exchanged between devices is linked to telephone numbers are stored centrally and can only be accessed by authorities.  
One leaking point in terms of coverage lies here within. Suppose you are a tourist trapped in Singapore with your SIM card from your home country.
You would not be able to participate the system meanwhile system will not able to aware of your disease. 
Situation links to a "Sovereign Identity" need for coverage.
