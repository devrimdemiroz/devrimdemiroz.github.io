title:  "Contact Trace Identity Angle"
---


Approximately a week ago, decided to be a part of a solution about covid-19.
After chasing myself to a practical fit, attached to "Contact Trace" Softwares. 
Did a preliminary current analysis, can be found in  <a href="{% post_url 2020-03-28-Tracing-Contact-Tracing %}" target="_blank"> this </a>  post. 

However, ended up chasing usual "Identity Crisis" as an Identity and Access Management specialist in very same context.  


Eventhough many of the listed products listed in post 
<a href="{% post_url 2020-03-28-Tracing-Contact-Tracing %}" target="_blank"> Tracing "Contact Tracing"  </a>  claims to  
comply with GDPR or equivalent, respecting user's anonymity etc. , still there are a number of open points regarding 
Identity as a concept itself.  

Not only bounded with privacy issues, while ensuring end to end coverage in terms of 
"Sovereign Identity", also respect human values, evaluate future, be fast , be efficient , think practical ...

What do we have in hand?
