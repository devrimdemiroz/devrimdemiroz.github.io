## 4 - Aggregation on collector
https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1378#discussion_r860658223
"Such TraceQL in my point of view as well needs to be available on the collection point with the aggregation feature. 
I would prefer to use TraceQL as a processor on the collector, especially for aggregation. 
This is a known tactic to overcome some usual cons. Filter more, have less cardinality, less noise... 
so to solve some of them with aggregation as a layer before it reaches to a storage layer."
