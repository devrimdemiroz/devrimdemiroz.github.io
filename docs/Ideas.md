As discussed in latest Grafana Agent community call https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftopI1chyG0&t=1080s "Focus on data flow..." section, I tried how i would like to extract a visual from otel-config.yaml.

### 3 - Flamegraph like tracing graphs
Still missing good old flame graphs , wonder if it is somehow achievable someday...

### 4 - Aggregation on collector

https://github.com/grafana/tempo/pull/1378#discussion_r860658223

Such TraceQL in my point of view as well needs to be available on the collection point with the aggregation feature. 
I would prefer to use TraceQL as a processor on the collector, especially for aggregation. 
This is a known tactic to overcome some usual cons. Filter more, have less cardinality, less noise... 
so to solve some of them with aggregation as a layer before it reaches to a storage layer.

### 5 - Trace Based Testing
Slowly they appear.

Trace based testing combination with Use Case Maps (UCM) urn modeling is worth looking into. With RUM and EUM aspects promises new doors towards testing.
